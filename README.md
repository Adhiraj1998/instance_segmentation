# instance_segmentation
This project deals with the task of implementing instance segmentation for a given dataset using Mask-RCNN architecture.

single.py executes instance segmentation for a single image provided as input.

dataset.py executes instance segmentation for an entire dataset of images.

progressive.py executes instance segmentation for an entire dataset of images and saves each instance progressively (1,2,3... so on).
